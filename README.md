# MonopolyDeal

### Updates:

- deck.py consists of an exhaustive list of cards
- card.py handles all types of cards

### Next steps:

- Potentially update card.py, specifically PropertyCard to hold rent values with multiple cards of the same color
- Chart out logic for player.py â€“ how their hand, properties on the table, and money on the table will all be taken care of

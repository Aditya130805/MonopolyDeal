# MonopolyDeal

### Updates:

- deck.py consists of an exhaustive list of cards
- card.py handles all types of cards
- 4 actions now supported: Pass Go, House, Hotel, and Sly Deal
- Charted out logic for player.py, taking care of their hand, properties, and bank
- 100% finished with house, hotel, and pass go actions

### Next steps:

- Potentially update card.py, specifically PropertyCard to hold rent values with multiple cards of the same color
- Implement more actions: Deal Breaker, Just Say No, Double the Rent, Debt Collector, and It's My Birthday
- Plan out and implement wild card functionality â€“ where it will be stored within properties and how it will be assigned colors
